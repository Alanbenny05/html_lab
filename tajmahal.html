  The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. 
  It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
